%EXTRACT_FEATURES Extracts the features of a audio signal based on the MFCC
%and the pitch of the signal.
%   Input: -mfcc_deltas, matrix NxMxC, MFCCs for N frames and M
%           coefficiants with C channels
%          -pitch_coeffs, vector NxC, pitch for N frames and C channels
%          -energy_coeffs, vector NxC, energy for N frames
%   Output: -features, vector Cx(M+7), extracted features from the inputs.
